# Apollonian-Gasket-Fractal-Generator-in-Java-
This project is a Java-based graphical application that generates and visualizes an Apollonian gasket fractal using recursive geometry. Built with Java Swing, the program demonstrates how complex fractal structures can emerge from simple mathematical rules.

The application recursively draws tangent circles inside a larger circle, creating a visually appealing fractal pattern. The recursion depth is configurable, allowing users to control the level of detail and complexity.

## Features
- *Recursive generation of Apollonian gasket fractals*
- *Adjustable recursion depth for different levels of detail*
- *Centered and dynamically scaled rendering*
- *Lightweight GUI built with Java Swing*
- *Clean and easy-to-understand implementation of fractal geometry*

## Technologies Used
- *Java*
- *Swing (Java GUI toolkit)*
- AWT Graphics2D*
